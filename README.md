For our final project, we have created a PvP soccer video game, using Pygame, with a shuffleboard type twist. There are two teams, Arsenal and Chelsea, each comprised of 4 players which are circular pucks. The game is taken in turns, and positions are reset when one team scores. Once one team reaches 3 goals, the game ends and you have the option to replay from a game over screen. 
How The Game Works
