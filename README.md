The game is comprised of 4 states/screens: Menu, Instructions, Game, and Game Over. Players navigate between these screens using keys with relevant instructions always displayed, altering a state variable in the code. Our code is abstracted into classes Ball, Player, and Bar. Each player is instantiated with characteristics such as position and team(which correspond to their image and coordinates) and held in a list of players. The ball is also instantiated but held in a separate variable. Both of these are unique to each “instance” of the game, whereas the power bar along with the scoreboard, title, field, and instructions all stay the same instance between games.
